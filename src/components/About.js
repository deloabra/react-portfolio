                  I am a fullstack Web Developer with education from UT Austin and a Certificate in Full Stack Development from Southern Methodist University.
                  I have skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and strengths in problem solving, meeting deadlines, and learning new technologies.
                  When working on projects, I strive to create a flexible product thatâ€™s easy to navigate, easy to update, and easy to look at.
                  I am excited to employ skills and partner with like-minded staff to create and improve websites in innovative ways.
